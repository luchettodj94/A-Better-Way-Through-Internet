# A-Better-Way-Through-Internet
Internet without harassmentt by ads company!


This is the part 3.5 and probably final tutorial that will create a safe navigation with no ads, privacy focus and no annoying stuff like cookies warning, it will include some part of the older tuto but lighter in ram consumption and with some more filters.

> **1) Install your favorite Chromium browser (like, Brave, Ungoogled, Chrome, Vivaldi, etc.) or Firefox.**

Other than all the below steps will be a good point to block any 3rd party cookies from your browser (check your settings and search for Privacy and Security) and block any connection that not come with https.

Furthermore I can recommend you to use https://etsi.me as your default search engine based on SearXNG, 

here you can find the "url query": https://etsi.me/search?q=%s

Alternatively https://neeva.com and its "ulr query": https://neeva.com/search?q=%s

Lastly if you still want to use your Google account (chrome, yt, drive, etc.) make sure to check the link below and disable everything you are not comfortable with:
https://myaccount.google.com/data-and-privacy

Same goes with Amazon services:

If you live in the EU make sure also to check those:
